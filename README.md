# Space Travel Booking Platform ðŸš€

This repository contains the project Space Travel Booking Platform. It is for a challenge of Global Prompt Engineering.

I use only ChatGPT to build this project. 

## Theme:
Dubai to the Stars â€“ The Ultimate Space Travel Experience

The future of travel is here! Imagine Dubai as the worldâ€™s first hub for commercial space travel. Your challenge is to code a platform that allows users to book and manage space station trips, check schedules, compare prices, and even find accommodation in space.

### The Challenge:

Develop a functional prototype of a space travel booking platform with the following features:

* Trip Scheduling & Booking: Allow users to choose departure dates, destinations (space stations, lunar hotels, etc.), and seat classes.

* Pricing & Packages: Display different travel optionsâ€”luxury cabins, economy shuttles, and VIP zero-gravity experiences.

* Accommodation Recommendations: Suggest space hotels or orbital stations based on user preferences.

* User Dashboard: A profile page where travelers can manage their bookings, see countdown timers for launch, and get AI-based travel tips.
